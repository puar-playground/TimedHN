# TimedHN
This is the source code of the Matlab implementation of TimedHN, a time-aware oncogenetic graph modeling method.<br />
<br />
1. The script `TimedHN_demo.m` is for the inferrence of the hazard network.<br />
2. The script `pseudo_order_demo.m` computes the conditional expectation of progression times using a learned hazard network.<br />
3. The script `simulation_demo.m` is for the generation of synthetic data.<br />
